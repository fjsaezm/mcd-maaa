Advanced methods in Machine Learning

In this subject, we have made 3 assignments:

- The first assignment consisted in the implementation of the **SVMs** technique **SMO** (Folder [P1](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd-maaa/tree/main/P1))

- In the second assignment we implemented the **Variable elimination algorithm** and, after that, we implemented **Gradient Boosting** (Folder [P2](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd-maaa/tree/main/P2))

- In the last assignment, we were given high-dimensional data and we used this data to study how **PCA** (and posterior clustering), **LDA** and combination feature extraction with **PCA** and classification with **LDA** performed on this data(Folder [P3](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd-maaa/tree/main/P3))
